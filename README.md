# Grayson's Nextbots
A Gorilla Tag mod that adds nextbots to the game!!!!!
By default the mod only spawns in a blank image with no audio. To fix this:
Download the mod, boot your game, then exit your game. Go to your plugins folder, open the "Grayson's Nextbots" folder, replace "logo.png" with any image either .jpg or .png. Rename it to "logo.png"
To add audio, replace the "ambience.ogg" with any OGG Vorbis file and rename it to "ambience.ogg"
If you have audio but it isn't an OGG Vorbis file, use https://www.freeconvert.com/mp3-to-ogg and convert it. It doesn't have to be MP3.
